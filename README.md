The experiment
- Create an SPA app without any JS library.

What I accomplished
- I was able to setup a type of routing for an SPA like app
- I added a few pages about the weather with limited features

What I learned
- React does a lot for me so I can focus on slinging features
- There is a lot more going on than I realized behind the JSX syntax.
